# rancheralias
Useful bash aliases for managing docker on RancherOS.


NOTE:
 This file works best with the ubuntu style bash terminal.

(Works even better with parrot's .bashrc, find it in jcdavenport/parrotbashrc)



On the rancher command line, enter:

$ sudo ros console switch ubuntu

select "Y" when prompted to restart terminal.




To use:

Copy rancher.bash_aliases to home folder and rename it .bash_aliases


Then restart bash by entering

$ source ~/.bashrc
